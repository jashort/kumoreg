Security
=====================

Users will belong to a certain [Role](roles.md), and each Role has one or more [Rights](rights.md) that grant them 
access to different areas of the application. For example, regular Staff might have the "pre_reg_check_in" right, 
which allows them to check in pre-registered attendees. If coordinators had "pre_reg_check_in" as well as 
"reprint_badge", they could also reprint badges for an attendee that had already checked in.
